## 💡 Key Facts

### Cost
- **Fly.io free tier:** 3 VMs, 256MB each ✅
- **Groq free tier:** $5 credit + 10K requests/day ✅
- **Monthly cost:** **$0** ✅

### Performance
- **LLM inference:** ~200ms (Groq is ultra-fast)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Build failed"
```powershell
flyctl logs --tail 50
# Check for missing package in requirements.txt
```

### "App won't start"
```powershell
flyctl logs
# Check: Redis connection, GROQ_API_KEY set
```

### "Deployment takes too long"
```powershell
# Normal! First build is ~3 min, deploy ~2 min
# Subsequent deploys are faster
flyctl logs --tail
```
